Medical Service App Color Theme Recommendation
For a medical service app, I'd recommend a color palette that balances professionalism, trust, and comfort:

Primary Colors
Medical Blue: #1E88E5 - Professional, calm, inspires trust
Soft Teal: #26A69A - Fresh, modern healthcare feel
Supporting Colors
Light Grey-Blue: #F5F7FA - Clean background
Pure White: #FFFFFF - Clinical, clean spaces
Dark Blue: #0D47A1 - For emphasis and important actions
Healing Green: #66BB6A - For success states and positive outcomes
Accent Colors
Soft Orange: #FF9800 - For calls to action, warm and inviting
Lavender: #9575CD - For secondary elements, calming
Text Colors
Deep Navy: #102A43 - Primary text, accessible and professional
Medium Grey: #627D98 - Secondary text and descriptions
Error Red: #EF5350 - Used sparingly for alerts/errors
This palette provides a clean, professional look while avoiding the sterile feeling of traditional healthcare environments. The combination of blues and teals creates trust while the accent colors add warmth and approachability.
